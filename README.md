# Monika-AI
This is an ongoing project of mine to create a functional self-hosted smart-home AI with a Client and Server.

#Projections
1.) Have a Client-Server connection using a Server and Multiple Raspberry Pis.
  1a.)  Alternatively, could just use one Server and connect various sensors to it for every room (Cameras, Microphones, Temperature, Barometer, ETC.
 
2.) Log and monitor daily intake of food automatically, adding a shopping list to your pc.
  2a.) Perhaps even your phone.
  
3.) Seamless integration with all IOT enabled devices in the house. (Philips HUE, Smart Locks, Televisions, Thermostats, Appliances, etc)

4.) Google search

5.) Learned/Taught responses

6.) Facial recognition with an Intruder alert. will know how to refer to someone by watching how already known people act towards a new person. Certain "permissions" must be manually set (Admin, Wife, Girlfriend, Husband, Boyfriend, Family). Will be able to differentiate between a picture and a person.

7.) Speech recognition with the same permissions and functions as #6. These will be tied in together.

8.) Available functions based on who is in what room, who is speaking, what they are looking at, and data of the room (temp, moisture, food intake and how much food is in storage.

9.) No personal data will be stored in a cloud or in github. Everything will be custom encrypted on the server.
